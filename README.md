<h1 align="center">EarlyGame</h1>
<p align="center">A Fabric mod focusing on changing early game aspects to make the game feel more "realistic".</p>

## Background
This idea revolves around the fact that as of this writing, no such mods for early game realism are present in the Fabric mod database. Then I thought, "Fine, I'll do it myself." Moreover, it was inspired by two particular Forge mods that have the same premise, namely [No Tree Punching (1.12.2/1.15.2/1.16.4)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/no-tree-punching) and [Natural Progression (1.14.4/1.15.2/1.16.4)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/natural-progressions).

## Features

- Disabled the ability to get wood from punching trees
- Proper tools are required to collect stone and wood
- Chopping logs to make planks, and planks to sticks
- Rocks and sticks are naturally generated around the world
- Cobblestone variants
- Makeshift flint tools
- Copper items, tools and armor
- Knives and saws serving as alternatives

More details are in the [wiki](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/wiki).

## Dependencies
### Required
- **[Fabric API](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabric-api)** (0.30.0+1.16 and above)
### Optional
- **[Mod Menu](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/modmenu)**: in-game configuration
- **[Roughly Enough Items](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roughly-enough-items)**: for crafting new tools

## Known Issues
- Recipes such as copper and flint tools cannot be unlocked for some reason.
- Some crafting recipes in the vanilla crafting guide are rendered blank; accessing it causes a game crash.

Incompatibilities and bugs can be reported in the [issues](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/issues) section.

## Credits
- **Mojang** (official copper block, ore and ingot textures)
- **Fabric Discord community** (a great help for the code)
- **Contributors** (for the help with issue fixes and other modifications)
- **You** (for playing with this mod!)

### Any plans for a Forge version?
A Forge version of this particular mod is not necessary. I recommend the two aforementioned mods if you want to play an early game mod on Forge.
