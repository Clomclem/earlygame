## 1.18.2-1.1.2
EarlyGame has successfully been ported to 1.18.2! Bear in mind there will be no backporting of this mod to previous point releases to focus on the latest one. This applies to every Minecraft major release. With all that said, sorry for the VERY long wait and I hope you enjoy!
- (+) All features from [1.17.x](https://github.com/JayCeeCreates/earlygame/blob/1.17/CHANGELOG.md) versions
- (+) Parity with MAmbience's sound effects when equipping tools and weapons
- (*) Changed the algorithm of sticks and rocks generation in line with the new worldgen update (#35 #36 #37 very huge thanks, Jurklein!)
